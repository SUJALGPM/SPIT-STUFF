// 24. Add 2 non-negative numbers that have been given as a linked list Given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. 
//     The most significant digit comes first and each of their nodes contains a single digit. 
//     Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list. You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself. 
//     Example 1: operand_1: 7 → 2 → 3 → 3
//     result: 
//     Example 2: operand_2: 5 → 7 → 4 
//     result: 7 → 8 → 0 → 7
